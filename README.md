# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. It allows two players to take turns and play on a 4x4 game board until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Once you have the compiler set up, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine and compile the code using your preferred method.

## How to Play
1. Run the complied executable
2. Enter the names of the two players when prompted.
3. The game board will be displayed with empty spaces for each cell.
4. Players will take turns entering the row and column number where they want to place their marker (either "x" or "o").
5. The game will continue until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
6. The winner (if any) will be displayed at the end of the game.
